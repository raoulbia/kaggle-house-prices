### Practicing Machine Learning: Linear Regression

#### Introduction

The goal of this repository is to implement **linear regression** without using 
off-the-shelf machine learning libraries. My DIY implementation of logistic regression is based 
on the 
[Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
course by Stanford University. The dataset was sourced from the 
[Kaggle House Price prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition

**A note on Feature Engineering**

In order to focus on the machine learning aspect, I chose not not to spend time
on the (very important) step of feature engineering. Instead I use publicly available code to 
pre-process the raw data before submitting it to my algorithms. 
The source for any data wrangling code I use is available in the *data_clean_name.py* files.

#### Implementation Notes

I immplemented linear regression using *regularized gradient descent*. 

To evaluate the algorithm I implemented:
 
 * a *cost history curve* function to check whether cost converges to a minimum 
 * a *learning curve* to analyze the algorithm in terms of *bias* and *variance*

#### House Price predictions scored by Kaggle

* hyper-parameters: 
  * num iterations = 1000
  * learning rate = 0.3 
  * regularization term = 1.2
  
* Results: 
  * root mean squared logarithmic error 0.34
  * leaderboard position  4678 (as of 07/2018)

<br>

#### Notes 

* Feature normalization **is required** for linear regression.

* Regularization is applied to the computation of gradients **and** to the computation of the 
cost.
